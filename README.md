A small app for tracking your Critterpedia progress in Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch.

Saves data to localStorage. Uses [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) (and [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)) for satae management, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for tests.

Critter images are taken from the [Animal Crossing Wiki] (https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/) at [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/).

Created with *create-react-app*. See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
